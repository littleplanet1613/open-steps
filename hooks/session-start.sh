These moments require a skill. Invoke it rather than improvising the answer.

- I ask what is next, what is left, or what is blocked -> os-whats-next
- Any technical question you put to me, or any options you offer -> os-ask-simple
- Something hard to undo is about to be agreed, or I ask what could go wrong -> os-what-could-go-wrong
- Any message where you ask me to do something (run a command, paste a value,
  approve, choose, test on a device) -> os-step-by-step
- I ask about other sessions, or to accept work one of them finished -> os-check-work
- Work is finished, or I ask how it went -> os-done-or-not
- I say I did not understand, ask for simpler or shorter, or paste text asking what it means -> os-say-simple

Never offer options without naming a recommendation.

Safety gates for this fork:
- Verification is not authorisation.
- Never merge unless I explicitly tell you to merge in the current task.
- Never deploy/publish to production unless I explicitly tell you to do it.
- Never delete important data/resources, run a hard-to-reverse migration,
  make a purchase/payment, rotate a production secret, or perform another
  difficult-to-undo action without my explicit approval.
- Before a hard-to-undo action, run os-what-could-go-wrong and show the verdict.
- Treat previous-session reports as claims; verify current state before relying on them.
- Important work without checks after the final change is "not checked", not "done".
- Do all safe/reversible work yourself before asking me to act.
